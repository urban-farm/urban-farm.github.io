  <p>The Allen Street Neighborhood Center is located in the East Side neighborhood in Lansing, Michigan. Just three miles from the Michigan State University campus to the east and only a mile from the capitol of the State of Michigan, the Neighborhood Center is situated in a diverse corridor that represents a range of socioeconomic statuses, ethnicities, ages, marital statuses, and life stories. The Allen Neighborhood Center is the site of the only farmers market in the Capitol Region to host a year-round farmers market. The Center provides a large, open space indoor where vendors can set out their goods on tables. An upstairs area provides tables for customers to sit and enjoy fresh food and relax, or just gaze down at the vendors and exchanges below. <br></br>

  Central to the Center is a full kitchen that is host to the Allen Market Place, a food hub. According to the Allen Market Place website, the kitchen serves as “a wholesale market for local foods, a licensed incubator kitchen, rental space for events or meetings, and a year round farmers market.” In addition, the space hosts a “farm-to-fork” program that helps connect local farmers and food producers with wholesale buyers such as restaurants, hospitals, grocers, and schools. Further, the Allen Neighborhood Center is host to a microbrewery situated adjacent to the kitchen, where members from the community can purchase locally-brewed beer.<br></br>

  To add to the richness of community connections at the Allen Neighborhood Center, just three blocks away the Hunter Park GardenHouse offers a number of educational programs and a community CSA (with bike delivery available). Further adding to the area’s progressive sensibility to healthy lifestyles, a community bike center called the Lansing Bicycle Coop (also offering educational opportunities and outreach) is located less than a block from the Allen Neighborhood Center. To put it briefly, the Allen Neighborhood Center is situated to transform community engagement and healthy, farm-to-table lifestyles in a diverse urban community—especially when triangulated with the Hunter GardenHouse and the Lansing Bicycle Coop.</p></div>
