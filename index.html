  <h3>About<h3></div>

<div class= "p">
  <p>Farmers markets serve a vital role in communities across the United States. Supporting local farmers and developing local food systems are just two of the many benefits that farmers markets can have on cities and neighborhoods. In addition, farmers markets help create visibility to both global and local issues in food access and food security, provide formal and informal education for visitors about organic and sustainable farm-to-table food practices, and build a sense of community. As the term market in farmers market clearly indicates, the farmers market is a center of economic activity and the exchange of goods. The farmers market also serves as a microcosm for complex and diverse cultural exchange. However, depending on the location, architecture, marketing, ownership, management, and outreach of farmers markets across America, these microcosms can be vastly different and facilitate very different kinds of experiences and exchanges—for all stakeholders in the process, from vendors (farmers) to consumers (local members of the community).<br></br>

  Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of farmers markets, however, is their ability to serve as pluralistic, quasi-public spaces that facilitate spontaneous and friendly interactions among strangers, where “trusting attitudes can be infectious, even spreading feelings of community across racial and ethnic lines” (Anderson, 2004, pg. 16). Elijah Anderson entitled these spaces cosmopolitan canopies, where diverse residents can visit and escape from the wariness of postmodern life. At one end, farmers markets operate as cosmopolitan canopies that help facilitate and build a sense of community while also promoting local food systems and lifestyles. At the other, they can function as spaces that represent white, middle-class values and attitudes and homogenous neoliberal agendas that fail to connect with diverse members of urban communities.<br></br>

  This website features several farmers markets that demonstrate how these public spaces serve as vital centers for complex social exchange and change. There are also several programs featured that highlight how farmers markets can serve as hubs for meaningful community development. Lastly, the resources provided help situate how farmers markets operate in local, sustainable food systems.</p></div>
